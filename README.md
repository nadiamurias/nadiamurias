## 🚀 About me 

Hi there! Im Nadia, passionate about the digital world and new technologies. I am eager to continue learning in this new environment.

After 4 years of experience as a web analyst I felt the need to evolve and grow towards a more technical profile. Thanks to my positive attitude, commitment and perseverance I have achieved my goal of becoming a front end developer.

I enjoy working in a team, learning from others and contributing with my creativity, resolution capacity, empathy and, of course, always with a smile 😃  and a great desire to evolve.
